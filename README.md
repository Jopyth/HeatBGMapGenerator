# HeatBGMapGenerator

HeatBGMapGenerator is a web-based tool for generating, editing, and exporting racing track maps, designed for use with the game "Heat: Pedal to the Metal".

## Features

- **SVG Track Import**: Load SVG files to use as the base for your track map.
- **Interactive Editing**: Pan, edit, curve, and add kerbs or white lines to your track interactively.
- **Chicanes**: In Curves mode, right-click (or ctrl-click) the second curve of a chicane to mark it as a chicane end (saved as `chicane_end` on that segment). It pairs with the curve before it, and both must share a speed limit; the pair then gets one corner weather tent and one section tent after the chicane end.
- **Visual Customization**: Adjust visual settings such as segment numbers, speed limits, track width, colors, and more.
- **Export Options**: Export your track as PNG or SVG images for use in other applications or sharing.
- **Session Management**: Save and load your work, including restoring previous sessions.
- **Track Data Management**: Save and load track data in JSON format for further editing or sharing.
- **Asset Support**: Includes support for custom icons (e.g., speed limit, distance signs) and multiple SVG track templates.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` — Main web interface for the track generator.
- `track-generator.js` — Core JavaScript logic for track editing and generation.
- `tracks/` — Folder containing SVG templates for different tracks.
- `*.png` — Image assets used in the UI and exports.

## Getting Started
